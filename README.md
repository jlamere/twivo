 I hate spoilers.

Seriously, they are the worst.
Now, I love following the stars of my favorite tv shows, but they often spoil my shows by live tweeting before I watch the show.
Which is why I created this nifty app - a Tivo for Twitter, or as I like to call it, Twivo.
=======

First of all, this will need to be installed as an extension in chrome or firefox

Secondly, type in tags used by your favorite show (etc #DanceMoms, Dance Moms) and hit record. All tweets with this phrase will be blocked from your view

Hit stop when the show ends.

When you are ready to watch the show, hit play, and the previosly hidden tweets will be visible, and will stream down in order!
======


Things to remember:
1. This is a work in progress
2. This is hacking code
3. GreaseMankey, though wonderful, does not mix well with APIs.
4. This hack was prepared with the intent of being demoed, though I may make a better version if I feel like it.
